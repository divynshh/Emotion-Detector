## Mental Health Predictor Tool

### Problem Statement
 
* Lots of support and aid available to improve physical well-being. But despite how common mental health problems are, there is very little provision to identify and improve mental health. 
* We are experiencing a severe mental health crisis aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.•Mental health disorders affect one-fifths of people in the US.
* 40% of Americans developed symptoms of anxiety or depression or both last year due to the fear of illness, self-isolation, grief, or deepening financial concerns.
* “There’s a significant body of research that demonstrates that individuals suffering from anxiety disorders and depression face an increased risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts,” said Dr. Mark Pollack, president of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.We need to act right now to help those who need it, and to prevent a much more serious and widespread mental health crisis.
